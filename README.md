# My Journey on the Data Structures and Algorithms Rabbit Hole

One of my learning goals this year has been to develop a deep understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms. 

As someone from a non-CS background who jumped relatively deep into the AI pool, I decided to go on this new learning path for the following reasons:
(1) Learn more about something that has always excited me--Algorithms
(2) Expand my programming skillset
(3) Maybe stand a chance at being able to solve those campus placement coding questions 

In order to begin this learning journey, I decided to first learn C++. 
I did this to challenge myself with a new programming language and to make sure I steered away from using built-in functions as much as possible. 
To get a basic understanding of C++, I did the C++ FULL COURSE For Beginners (Learn C++ in 10 hours) by CodeBeauty. 
A well explained series, the YouTube course helped me understand the basics of C++ while introducing me to topics such as Object Oriented Programming.
With the basics of C++ in hand, I decided to pursue the Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization by University of California San Diego. 

I'll be honest and put it out there that this is not my first attempt at the UC San Diego DSA Specialization. 
I had registered for the courses around the summer of 2020. 
However, I failed to make it passed the first few weeks for the following reasons:
(1) I was intimidated by the topics taught in the course and struggled to understand the same
(2) I attempted to solve questions with little to no understanding of what I was supposed to implement.
(3) I did the above after spending only an hour learning C++.
(3) I did not spend time trying to understand the concepts taught primarily because I was fully invested in a research project

Thus, I went down a path of attemtping to understand where I went wrong. 
Several YouTube videos and Medium articles later, coupled with a better understanding of C++, I decided to venture into this learning journey again.
This repository is meant to be used as a means of self tracking so that I consistently learn and enjoy the fruits of my work through a neatly maintained repo. 
The code implemented will not always be the most efficient. However, I will do my best to keep the programs I implement clean, error free and clear all the edge cases.
