# My Journey on the Data Structures and Algorithms Rabbit Hole

One of my learning goals this year has been to develop a deep understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms. 

As someone from a non-CS background who jumped relatively deep into the AI pool, I decided to go on this new learning path for the following reasons:
(1) Learn more about something that has always excited me--Algorithms
(2) Expand my programming skillset
(3) Maybe stand a chance at being able to solve those campus placement coding questions 

In order to begin this learning journey, I decided to first learn C++. 
I did this to challenge myself with a new programming language and to make sure I removed all temptations that came with
